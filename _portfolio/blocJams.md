## Explanation

BlocJams is a digital music player similar to Spotify. The website was built to practice and gain understanding of web development concepts. 

## Problem

The aim was to build a simple online music player which would be highly usable, responsive and aesthetically pleasing.

## Solution

Three pages were implemented: the landing page, the collection page and the album page. The pages feature minimalistic contemporary design. The website uses **jQuery** as the main library to handle user interactions. Sound was handled by the **Buzz** library.

## Results

BlocJams is a beautiful responsive website. It responds to changes in browser window size and looks good both on a phone and a desktop computer.

## Conclusion

Making the website allowed me to put some of my web development knowledge into practice and also learn a lot of new things. During the course of development I practiced styling the page with CSS, dynamically altering the contents of pages using JavaScript and learned a couple of libraries. I am now building on that experience in the hopes of creating more complex webpages and applications.
